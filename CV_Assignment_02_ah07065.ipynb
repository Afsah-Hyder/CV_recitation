        "Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) are the most suitable architecture for restoring the missing detail in the blurred HD images. Unlike general-purpose GANs, SRGANs are specifically designed for super-resolution tasks. Their strength lies in a combined loss function that incorporates both an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss trains the network to generate images that appear realistic to a discriminator network, mimicking natural high-resolution photos. The content loss, however, ensures the generated image retains the essential details and features present in the blurred version. This targeted approach makes SRGANs well-suited for recovering the lost information in the corrupted HD images."
